            <h2>Data Source: </h2>
            <p>The data here is generated by using a global earth system model called the Community Earth System Model (CESM) developed and maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. CESM combines models of processes happening in our atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice to produce computer simulations of Earth’s past, present, and future climate states. CESM is a collaborative project drawing on Earth system science research across the globe. </p>
            <h2>Modeling and Uncertainty: </h2>
            <p>All models include uncertainty. This uncertainty is represented by the shaded areas in the charts above, which shows the range of possible extremes. The darker line within the shaded areas shows an average, or most, likely expected outcome within the range of possibilities.  </p>
            <h2>Spatial Scale and Inputs: </h2>
            <p>This modeled data is generated for a one degree (roughly 60x 60 mile grid cell in the central Willamette Valley that includes Salem, Oregon, and surrounding areas. Key inputs include soil properties (texture and carbon content) and vegetation cover (forests, grasslands, and crop regions), which are described by surface datasets that are used as inputs to the land model. </p>
            <h2>Variables:</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Minimum temperature:</b> Select this variable to view changes in the average minimum temperature for month, year, or decade generated by the model over time. Uncertainty is represented by the shaded areas. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Maximum temperature:</b> Select this variable to view changes in the average maximum temperature for month, year, or decade generated by the model over time. Uncertainty is represented by the shaded areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Precipitation:</b> Select this variable to view changes in average precipitation (rain and snow) for month, year, or decade generated by the model over time. Uncertainty is represented by the shaded areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Soil moisture:</b> Select this variable to view changes in soil moisture at a depth of 10 centimeters for month, year, or decade generated by the model over time. Uncertainty is represented by the shaded areas.

            <h2>Explanation of Data Shown:</h2>
            <p>Beginning around the year 2000, the model shows a consistent increase (warming) in the monthly, annual, and decadal average minimum and maximum temperatures in the Willamette Valley, although cold months/years that dip below the average can still be expected. </br>
              In contrast, the model indicates that precipitation patterns are likely to remain fairly constant in the Willamette Valley until 2100 with periods of drought years but no significant overall decline in precipitation. </br>
              Despite the relatively constant precipitation, soil moisture levels within the model are declining notably after approximately 1980. This is caused by processes other than precipitation, such as increased temperatures driving higher rates of evapotranspiration. Comparing the seasonal charts for soil moisture during the 1980s and the 2020s or later also shows that soils are drying out earlier in the year. This data suggests farmers may want to use practices that increase moisture retention in the soil. </br>
